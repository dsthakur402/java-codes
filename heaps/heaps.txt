Heap

Binary Tree (BT): A binary tree is a tree structure where each node has at most two children.

Complete Binary Tree (CBT):

A CBT is a binary tree in which all levels are completely filled, except possibly the last level.
If the last level isnâ€™t fully filled, nodes are placed from left to right.
Heap Order Property:

Min-Heap: Each parent node is smaller than or equal to its children. Children >= Parent(minHeap)
Max-Heap: Each parent node is larger than or equal to its children. Children <= Parent(maxHeap)
